/**
 * Fiber class
 * a fiber is a userspace thread with it's own context. They can be used to
 * implement coroutines, emulated threading systems and certain asynchronous
 * patterns.
 *
 * This class implements fibers at a low level, thus allowing greater freedom
 * to implement such patterns. This fiber class is 'threadsafe' only one fiber
 * can be running at a time and threads will be locked while trying to yield to
 * a running fiber until it yields. WARNING exchanging two running fibers between
 * threads will cause a deadlock. In order to prevent a deadlock, each thread should
 * have an intermediary fiber, you switch to the intermediary fiber of the current
 * thread and then from it switch to the expected fiber. This way you can exchange
 * 2 fibers within 2 different threads.
